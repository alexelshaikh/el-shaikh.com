Hi, I am Alex El-Shaikh, a researcher with a background in Computer Science. I am 32 years old and have a multicultural heritage—I am half German and half Egyptian. My passion for understanding and improving technology has shaped my academic journey. I hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s in Computer Science, and my PhD research focused on an emerging and fascinating field: developing random access capabilities for DNA storage systems.

This research has fueled my curiosity about innovative approaches to data storage and how we can meet the growing need for more efficient and scalable systems. Beyond DNA storage, I am particularly interested in areas like parallel computing, algorithms, and database systems, where I enjoy tackling challenges and finding creative, practical solutions.

For me, research is about constant learning and discovery. I love exploring new ideas, taking on new challenges, and working with others who share that same curiosity. Thanks for stopping by my page—feel free to reach out if you would like to connect or discuss any ideas!
