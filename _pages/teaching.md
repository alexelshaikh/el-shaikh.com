It has always been a deeply rewarding experience for me. I enjoy breaking down complex topics into simple, understandable concepts and sharing my enthusiasm for learning with students. It's fulfilling to see students grow their skills and confidence through engagement and collaboration.

## Exercise Sessions

I have organized and conducted numerous exercise sessions to support lectures for both bachelor’s and master’s students. These sessions covered a broad range of topics, including:

- Linear Algebra
- Analysis
- Database Systems
- NoSQL Databases
- Geo-databases
- Software Engineering
- Programming Internships
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Efficient Algorithms

## Student Supervision

I have also had the privilege of supervising **six bachelor’s and master’s students** in Computer Science at the University of Marburg. Guiding them through their thesis projects on **DNA data storage** has been one of the highlights of my teaching journey. It's incredibly rewarding to help students navigate challenging topics and watch them develop their ideas into successful outcomes.

Teaching is not just a role for me—it's a chance to connect, inspire, and learn alongside students.
